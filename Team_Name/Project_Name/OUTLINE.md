# Project Structure (Metaschool Road To Web3 Cohort - II)

This repository outlines the recommended structure for organizing your project in the context of Metaschool's Road To Web3 Cohort - II. Proper organization enhances code maintainability and collaboration.

**Note**: Most directories contain a `.placeholder` file to ensure the directory structure is maintained as Git does not track empty directories. Feel free to ignore or delete this file as you add content to the directories.

1. **Root Directory**:
   - `README.md`: Entry point document explaining the project, setup, and contribution guidelines.
   - `LICENSE`: Legal terms under which the software is used and shared.
   - `.gitignore`: Files and directories Git should ignore.
   - `CHANGELOG.md`: Log of changes for each version.
2. **Source Code (`/src`)**:
   - `/contracts`: Smart contracts (Solidity files for Ethereum, etc.).
   - `/lib`: Reusable libraries or helper functions.
   - `/services`: Backend services like APIs, data processing scripts.
   - `/frontend`: Front-end application code.
3. **Testing (`/tests`)**:
   - Subdirectories for different testing levels: `unit/`, `integration/`, and `e2e/`.
4. **Documentation (`/docs`)**:
   - `api/`: API documentation.
   - `contracts/`: Documentation for smart contracts.
5. **Scripts (`/scripts`)**:
   - `/deploy`: Deployment scripts.
   - `/utils`: Utility scripts.
6. **Configuration (`/config`)**:
   - Configuration files and `.env.example`.
7. **Project Management (`/project`)** (Optional based on project scope):
   - `roadmap.md`: Project roadmap.
